        <h1 class="R1">The Quest</h1> 
        <p class="kit">Sammy, Rosie, Frankie, and Taylor live in a world of their own as players of QUEST, a fantasy role-playing game - but everything changes when Taylor assigns them quests in the real world, and they’re forced to exchange their imaginary monsters for real ones.</p>  
        <img class="nemo" src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1657564814/hlsiub1gneqhzkgjanew.jpg" alt="">
        <h1 class="R1">Our Story</h1>
        <p class="kit">Murray Foster & Kieren MacMillan were (and are) music-loving, beat-up-as-a-kid, Dungeons-and-Dragons-playing nerds, and in their first-ever collaboration, it’s only fitting that they create a show set in the “Nerdverse,” exploring the hierarchy within the realm of nerds, geeks, dorks, and dweebs, with four brainy teenage girls at the forefront of this story of friendship and facing your fears.</p>
        <p class="kit">THE QUEST made its debut in 2021 as a virtual presentation by the Bravo Academy New Music Theatre Intensive which provides innovative music theatre training, specializing in contemporary musicals for our next generation of performers.</p>
        <p class="kit">In May, the talented performers from Randolph Kids, the pre-college youth program of Randolph College for the Performing Arts, will bring their 70-minute version of the show to the Toronto stage.

            This Randolph Kids performance was the first time Murray and Kieren had the chance to see the show performed in person due to restrictions on performances and travel throughout its pandemic development. 
            
            All of the previous workshop productions have provided valuable insights on the development of the music, story, and characters, and we’re grateful to everyone who has supported the THE QUEST thus far. What is needed now is an in-person, full-length workshop led by the writers themselves to complete their personal quest of bringing this show to life.</p>
       
        <img class="nemo" src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1657564838/mzheifymjwi6acmwyfcy.jpg" alt="">
        <h1 class="R1">What We Need</h1>
        <p class="kit">Murray and Kieren are planning a full-length workshop performance with professional actors to be held in Toronto, ON on Saturday, September 24, 2022. This performance will be a ‘books and stands’ performance ⁠— no choreography or blocking, just the actors acting the parts and singing the songs. You’ll be amazed at how well professionals can bring it to life ⁠— and the singing will be out of this world!

            Staging a workshop is an expensive endeavor, and we expect it will cost $10,000 to produce this workshop. Your financial support will allow us to make the most of this final development stage of THE QUEST. </p>
        <img class="nemo" src="https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1657564862/dnldgx5yglykprqxubr9.jpg" alt="">
        <h1 class="R1">The Impact</h1>
        <p class="kit">As a backer of THE QUEST, you make a huge difference in the development of a new musical with a female-driven cast that puts high school society’s underdogs front and center. 

                     A musical can seem perfect on the page, but you have to perform it on a stage with an audience in the room to really be sure the parts all work together. You’re giving us that opportunity!
        
                       By supporting THE QUEST, you’re not only supporting the creative vision of Murray and Kieren, you’re putting a dozen actors back to work after two years of pandemic restrictions in addition to supporting the creative team and theatres who are making this workshop possible. 
        
                           Once we complete this workshop performance, THE QUEST will head out into the world where we hope it will be performed in theatres everywhere as an inspiration for anyone who feels a little different and could use a little help facing their own fears.</p>
